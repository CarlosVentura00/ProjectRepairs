To run this project you will need to store the dabase "HitachiRepairs" on sql server
(thats what i used).

After that, open the project solution, you might need to install the dependencies.


For the API connection to work, go to the "appsettings.json" and change the line
"DefaultConnection: "data source= your database connection" (you can find it on the "connect"
button on sql server, a small window will popup, select the "server name" field and copy it)

The API connection runs through "http://localhost:3000", if you have this port blocked/in use
you might need to change the port. For that open the "Startup.cs" on the "configure" method
you will find the line to change it.

When you click on the "run button" on visual studio, the app will open the browser.
On the url field you might see something like "localhost:44374" if this is not the port for you
then on the project, go to "ClientApp/src/containers/Requests.jsx" there you will see
close to the top "fetch(.......)", change the localhost port to the one that appears in your
browser.


To use the databases you need to attach the files in this project on the path:C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MYDB\MSSQL\DATA
